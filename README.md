# ProjectManager

About: The objective of the program is to create a growable container for a Team so it could hold Team Member objects and their specific data field entries, name and start date. The program takes in commands which will either Add, Remove, or Output the team.

  Commands - 
    Add ( A ) - add a new team member; input ex: "A John 12/12/2012"
  
    Remove ( R ) - remove a team member; input ex: "R John 12/12/2012"
  
    Print ( P ) - print all team members on the team, displays "We have 0 team members!" if team is empty
  
    Quit ( Q ) - display team members on team, display "The team is ready to go!", and terminate the program 
  

Background: This project is an assignment for Software Methodology (CS213) and was completed by my partner and I. The professor provided the bare minimum, such as: the names for the files, classes, and methods. We were also provided a sample input/output test cases which we had to match.
